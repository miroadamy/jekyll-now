<p>Trying to install <a href="http://www.atg.com/">ATG</a> on the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Overview" target="_blank">Linux</a> platform turned out to be not completely hickup-free. The default installer died with the following message:</p>
<p>[sourcecode language='css']<br />
$ ./ATG2007.1.bin<br />
Preparing to install...<br />
Extracting the installation resources from the installer archive...<br />
Configuring the installer for this system's environment...<br />

Fortunately, the fix was easy after I found out what went wrong: incorrect assumption about kernel version. To make it work, this "hack" helped:<br />
[sourcecode language='css']<br />
$ mv ATG2007.1.bin ATG2007.1.bin.orig<br />
$ cat ATG2007.1.bin.orig | sed "s/export LD_ASSUME_KERNEL/#xport LD_ASSUME_KERNEL/" &gt;ATG2007-1.bin[/sourcecode]<br />
None of this of course happens on Windows - oh, yes - the joys of not swimming with the crowd :-). You will encounter issues otherwise unknown - but also learn something in the process.</p>
