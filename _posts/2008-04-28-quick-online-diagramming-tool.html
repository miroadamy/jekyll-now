<p>I am using OmniGraffle for most of my diagrams. OmniGraffle is an OS-X platform replacement for Visio - only easier to use and better looking (in my opinion). On rare occasions I do not work on my notebook, it is quite useful to have free alternative that allows to create a diagram that does not look too awful, without going through the hoops of downloading and installing software. The bubl.us is exactly that tool.</p>
<p>Using <a href="http://www.bubbl.us/index" target="_blank">bubl.us</a> you can very quickly create visual representation of simple structure with basic relations (parent/child) and links. You can define the text and links between elements and save the result as XML, HTML or JPG/PNG image. The result can look e.g. like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://miroadamy.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/bubblus_new_sheet2.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-396" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/bubblus_new_sheet2.png" alt="" width="380" height="500" /></a></p>
<p>No a bad result, considering that its creation took less than 60 seconds.</p>
<p>If you need more control - like different shapes and stencils, look at Gliffy, which is much closer to actual desktop diagramming tool. It is free tool with paid enhanced version, available <a href="http://www.gliffy.com/gliffy/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
