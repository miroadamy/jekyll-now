<p>I did not even notice that the visit counter left the 16 bit domain sometimes during last few days. Now it shows about 67 000 visits. Honestly, I am pleasantly surprised how many people found this blog worthy their time :-). Thanks to you all ...</p>
<p>Next boundary is of course 128K, 256K, 512K hits and finally a "Megahit". But that's far far away.</p>
