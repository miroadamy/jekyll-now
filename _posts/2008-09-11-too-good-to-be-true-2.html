<p>If <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5048126/rumor-apple-macbook-event-on-oct-14" target="_self">this thing</a> is real, I am buying one. Regardless that I really, really do <em>not</em> need another Mac :-). Form factor of thin screen of size 9-12 inch, with reasonable subset of touch gestures would be EXACTLY what I need from a internet terminal / reader. Plus the option to tether it with iPhone for ubiquitous connectivity ...</p>
