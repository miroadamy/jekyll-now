<p>The centos 4.x we are using as platform for the VMWare VMs (yes, I know there is version 5, but we need to be compliant with RHEL 4.x because of the ATG requirements) installs by default the NTP client.</p>
<p>Here is sequence of steps that needs to be performed to enable automatic synchronization of the clocks.<br />
1) make sure the DNS works<br />
cat /etc/resolv.conf</p>
<p>sudo vi /etc/resolv.conf</p>
<p>- check that nameservers point to something meaningfull, e.g.<br />
nameserver 208.67.222.222<br />
nameserver 208.67.220.220<br />
nameserver 192.168.16.1</p>
<p>2) check that you have ntpd installed</p>
<p>cat /etc/ntp.conf</p>
<p>- inspect the content of the file, it is quite well documented</p>
<p>3) make it work in runlevels 2345</p>
<p>/sbin/chkconfig --list | grep ntpd</p>
<p>- this will most likely show "off" for all runlevels</p>
<p>sudo /sbin/chkconfig --level 2345 ntpd on</p>
<p>4) Initial sync</p>
<p>sudo /usr/sbin/ntpdate pool.ntp.org</p>
<p>- do this twice, on second you should get very small difference</p>
<p>5) Start service / restart service</p>
<p>sudo /sbin/service ntpd start</p>
<p>Making this a blog post so that next time I need to do it I can easily find it :-). Maybe somebody else will find it useful as well.</p>
